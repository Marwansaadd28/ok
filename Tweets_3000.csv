negative,"@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!"

negative,@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
negative,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
negative,@united I would never fly United Airlines again!
negative,@AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous
negative,@USAirways stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help.  You can do better than that.  @av_duffy
negative,@USAirways Only the JFK baggage office is open to help re-book all of us on Cancelled Flightled flight 3121 to DCA. Shameful.

hint: the end of it"
negative,@JetBlue @EllaHenderson the highlight of being delayed #freeconcert
negative,@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
negative,@SouthwestAir   Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait!
negative,@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
negative,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
negative,"@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue can you help? @SpiritAirlines is in the wrong, stuck in Florida 3days. They need to learn from real airlines."

negative,@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
negative,@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
negative,@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
negative,@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
negative,@JetBlue I'm sick of y'all.

negative,@usairways I just learned that although there is travel policy and they waive the change fee-you will still be charged a $25 reservation fee
negative,@SouthwestAir Your hold music needs 2 be fixed:certain tracks have loud phone button mashing tones in them.Estimated wait time would help 2.

negative,"@united if u miss first leg of ur flight, you have to pay hundreds of $'s just to keep your second leg? How much to keep my earned miles?"
negative,@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
negative,@AmericanAir the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating
negative,@JetBlue they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
negative,@AmericanAir Thanks for your canned response that makes it look like you care about your customers. I'm sure all Twitter users fall for it..
negative,"@USAirways That's 1h 10m waiting to get my bag, 1h40m of flight delays, plus the 2hrs of delay I had on the way out. Never flying you again."
negative,"@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient"
negative,@SouthwestAir boarded plane only to be told to get off as it wasn't our plane. Now an hour delay. 😭😭
negative,@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
negative,@JetBlue @philpete wonder if that's the pilot tweeting you back? Is it legal to tweet and fly? What if the plane in front stops suddenly?
negative,@USAirways this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable.
negative,@USAirways but only for certain flights from CLT-NYC. The notion that you can't rebook customers for 48 hours is absurd.
negative,@united how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been..

negative,@JetBlue it's sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What's the real reason?
negative,@SouthwestAir - you can do better than having someone on hold for over an hr http://t.co/FxNv618B1A
negative,@SouthwestAir Thank you.  Twitter says I can't DM someone unless they follow me.  Can @SouthwestAir follows my twitter?
negative,@united I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice

negative,@AmericanAir you need to have a look at your handling of flight 106 and 104. Company of yours size should have protocols in place to help
negative,"@JetBlue If your confirming to me that the rate won't go down again looks like I can't fly JetBlue this time around, can't afford that price"

negative,@united This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
negative,@SouthwestAir this is not a fair set up. I payed for a full seat. I should get access to a full seat. http://t.co/SbA0ARicyq
negative,. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
negative,@JetBlue I want you to pay for my parking fee at Orlando airport because your app told me my moms flight landed at 9:19 and it lied
negative,@USAirways 4 hours... 4 hours... FOUR HOURS.  It's like this is a joke to you.
negative,"@SouthwestAir no after 75 mins of hold, I finally hung up! Ridiculous wait times. Can you assist in Cancelled Flighting reservation?"
negative,"@USAirways I've been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate."
negative,@united how else would I know it was denied?

negative,"@USAirways yes, but I had to pay more for another flight to get me out tomorrow since there weren't anymore for tonight...not fun :-/"
negative,"@USAirways Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL"
negative,@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
negative,@USAirways They're all reservations numbers and none are in Hungary. And my phone not working here. You make it too difficult.
negative,@JetBlue what crew? No one here is helping.
negative,.@JetBlue yes. Filed a claim and they issued $30 credit as a courtesy. The whole thing seems exceptionally uncourteous to me.
negative,@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
negative,"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
negative,@SouthwestAir I am completely displeased with the service I received on yesterday flying from LGA to ATL.
negative,@SouthwestAir Been on hold for over an hour - any chance someone can help me on here?
negative,@USAirways Seriously. You can't tweet and let people know that you've got customers that have been on hold for 5 HOURS??!!
negative,@AmericanAir guess that's what I get for bragging on you. I fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they don't have other options JS
negative,@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
negative,@JetBlue supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided!
negative,@USAirways will you please update your website with the most current flight status? And update your customer service phone # on @google thx
negative,"@AmericanAir is terrible, my flights Cancelled Flighted and i've been on hold for the past 4 hours. Never again."

negative,"@USAirways @AuroraBIZ check your bag, @PHLAirport bag handlers broke into my suitcase and stole my camera, bag was returned in a trash bag"
negative,"@USAirways BF has been stuck in CLT all day. Is the lounge offering free ""This weather sucks &amp; we all want to cry"" tequila shots?"

negative,@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
negative,"@AmericanAir not sure what this means but son and I will certainly have operational needs for seats during Flt. 1679 next Friday, yet..."

negative,@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
negative,@united WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united
negative,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir so does that mean @AmericanAir that you might care about my sister be assaulted on one of your flights
negative,@SouthwestAir You've inspired me to start my own airline to combat your weak ass airline. sick of this shit
negative,@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn't look good. May have to stay here till Friday &amp; that's not guaranteed

negative,@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
negative,@USAirways Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.
negative,@VirginAmerica Use another browser! 2015 &amp; a brand with a reputation built on tech response doesn't have a cross-browser compatible website?
negative,@AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario
negative,@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
negative,@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12

negative,"@USAirways Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided."
negative,@SouthwestAir Nashville airport has runways open. It appears southwest is only airline Cancelled Flighting flights. Is this likely to change?
negative,@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
negative,@AmericanAir you can't change my flights and not have enough operators to handle calls.... #unacceptable #AmericanAirlines
negative,@VirginAmerica on VX399 from JFK to LA - dirty plane - not up to your standards.
negative,"@united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address."

negative,"@AmericanAir Nah, just horrible dining options outside of club. Luckily Manuel in the Admirals can make a Bloody Mary."
negative,@JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can't check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it's back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail
negative,@SouthwestAir step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don't suck so much
negative,@AmericanAir you need to work harder on the disconnect between your intention and the reality your passengers face
negative,@SouthwestAir 4 flights Cancelled Flightled in one week?! Customer Service is 💩💩💩💩
negative,"@USAirways I’ve had my flight Cancelled Flightled twice now, and after 5 minutes of automated questions, the phone just goes to a busy signal. Help?"

negative,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
negative,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...

negative,@JetBlue we want room and food allowances. Agents are refusing to give us vouchers to use at rooms we book ourselves.
negative,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
negative,@USAirways so upset with customer service. I have a simple question and the phone system has disconnected me all day today and yesterday.
negative,"@AmericanAir that 2 hr wait became a 4 hr one. And y'all claimed to have sent an email. Yeah, that never happened. #FlyDelta"
negative,@USAirways 😂. Passed frustrated 4 hours ago after being asked to get off the first plane I sat on for an hour.
negative,@united I must stop my relationship with you. You've become greedy and heartless and our long term relationship is over
negative,@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
negative,@USAirways I left an item on plane BOS-PHL on Friday.  I've called PHL US Airways # &amp; left 6 msgs. No return call what to do at this point.

negative,@SouthwestAir are people in an exit row still supposed to give their verbal approvals? I was never asked on the flight I'm on...
negative,@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
negative,@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
negative,"@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly."
negative,"@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space."
negative,@USAirways where's my apology?
negative,@AmericanAir not sure why we are being made to stand in line outside for plane that isn't ready to board when I could be sitting inside
negative,@SouthwestAir I understand a delay but to be stuck on the plane longer than the flight is unacceptable

negative,@united I’ve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received?
negative,@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice

negative,@SouthwestAir do you ever reinstate Cancelled Flighted flights?
negative,@SouthwestAir I thought you guys were the best airline...I've been on hold for an hour!
negative,@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
negative,"@JetBlue I was believing you for a minute, but we just got delayed for a 3rd time!"
negative,@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.

negative,@SouthwestAir I was told by customer service that only customer relations can extend the expiration date of my unused travel funds.
negative,@USAirways being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here
negative,"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
negative,@USAirways how is it that my flt to EWR was Cancelled Flightled yet flts to NYC from USAirways are still flying?
